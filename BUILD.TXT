This document describes the process of building an ISO to install Salix, Slackware or Slint, 
version 15.0 for architecture x86_64, using a Slint installer. In what follows the variable
$distribution can be salix, slackware or slint.

All paths are relative to the directory hosting this file, also named $ROOTDIR.

The ISO will include an initramfs customized adding and removing files to/from a genuine
Slackware64-15.0 one.

Before building, check that all variables set in $ROOTDIR/set_variables_* be up to date, including:
KVER and ISOVERSION.

Prerequisites: all packages to be included in the ISO and/or needed to customize the iniramfs should
be up to date.
This includes:
* (A local copy of) repositories from which packages are copied in the ISO or added to the initramfs.
* Packages in ./packages, to be added to the initramfs. Some are built by scripts in ./build:
  - build_firmware-installer => package firmware-installer, to provide the firmware needed during
    installation,
  - build_modules-installer => package modules_installer, including the kernel modules to be loaded
    during installation, associated to the kernel included in the initramfs,
  - build_installer-translations, to provide the translations of messages displayed by configuration
    scripts included in the Slint installer and replace by Salix or Slackware the word Slint in
    these translations according to $distribution,
  - extract_doc_installer_from_HandBook does what it says, for each of the provided locales.

Once the prerequisites have been met, building the ISO is done running these scripts in ./build,
some of which take as argument $distribution.
TIP: you can can set and export distribution and run all scripts with $distribution as argument. 

1. populate_iso_dir fetches and stores the packages to be included in the ISO in the directory
   $ISODIR directory that it creates.
2. add_metadata_to_the_iso adds to $ISODIR the metadata assoiated to the packages and a few files.
3. add_boot_equipment_to_the_iso adds to $ISODIR a directory /boot/grub and writes in it the file
   grub.cfg.
4. unpack_slackware_initrd unpack the file initrd.img got from 
   https://slackware.uk/slackware/slackware64-15.0/EFI/BOOT/initrd.img in ./initrd-tree.
5. customize_the_initrd adds to the initramfs packages needed to make the installer accessible with
   braille and speech and polyglot, includes files used to manage installation and customizes it for
   $distribution.
6. create_installer_initrd writes the file $ISODOR/initrd.
7. write_the_iso writes the ISO image.

These steps should be performed running the scripts in the following order:

prerequistes-------|->populate_iso_dir-|->add_metadata_to_the_iso----------|
get_latest_scripts-|                   |->add_booting_equipment_to_the_iso_|->write_the_iso
									   |->create_installer_initrd----------| 

TIP: if you wrote an ISO and find an issue with the initrd, once fixed you can rebuild and update it
in $ISODIR running add_booting_equipment_to_the_iso then write_the_iso again, without running again
the other scripts. 
                                                                                  
Customizing the ISO and the installer for $distribution is done mainly by two scripts sourcing the
file ./build/set_variables_$distribution that sets variables among which $SETS, list of sets of
packages to install in $distribution stored in ./sets.

- populate_iso_dir stores in $ISODIR/slint the packages sets listed in $SETS for $distribution,
  using slapt-get with the slapt-getrc file "$ROOTDIR/files-in-initrd/slapt-getrc.$distribution".
  It puts in $ISODIR/slint (for Slint) ot in $ISODIR/installer (for other distributions) packages
  that will be added to the initramfs by rc.S after having started it. For Slint it also adds
  packages only installed if the locale in their name fits the one selected by the user.
- customize_the_initrd adds to the installer:
  . the packages and files used to make it polyglot, accessible with speech and braille, including
    a package installer-translations-${distribution} built from po files adapted to $distribution,
  . the packages sets (list of packages to install) for all distributions and addonsinstaller, list
    of packages packages that the /etc/rc.d/rcS will add to the installer itself, stored in ./sets, 
  . the installation scripts /etc/rc.d/rc.S, /sbin/functions and /sbin/start, the latter adapted to
    the target $distribution, copying ./files-in-initrd/start"$distribution" as /sbin/start, and the
    files /slapt-getrc.installation$distribution.

Installation is customized for $distribution:
- through specific settings in /sbin/start:
  . $distribution set in /tmp/distro,
  . the list of sets of packages to install set in /tmp/set/,
  . a sed command replacing in /sbin/functions and /etc/rc.d/rc.d Slint by Salix or Slackware as
    needed to display the installer's messages accordingly.
  . a specific postconfigure$(cat /tmp/distro) function called by /sbin/start
- using the "-c /slapt-getrc.installation$distribution" as configuration file for slapt-getrc.
  
The sets of packages used to install a distribution are:
- For Salix: "bootstrapsalix aaa_base aaa core efi basic efi-gui fullsalix settings slintsalix"
- For Slackware: "bootstrapslackware aaa_base slackware slintslackware"
- For Slint: "bootstrapslint aaa_base full wpa_supplicant-nogui i3 lxqt mate"

Packages' installation process:
1. The script /etc/rc.d/rc.S (adapted from Slackware's installer) is started by init. After having
   enabled swap in zram to increase the usable RAM, it adds to the initramfs packages needed during
   installation, cf. lines 82-140 of ./files-in-initrd/rc.S. These packages, the same for all
   distributions, are listed in ./sets/addonsinstaller
2. The script /sbin/start (customized for each distribution), started by the user typing start,
   does some distribution specific settings, then calls functions of /sbin/functions.
3. The packages are installed in the target system by functions of /sbin/functions in the following
   order, after having mounted its root filesystem as /SLINT regardless of the distribution:
   - the package aaa_base, fetched from $ISO/slint
   - the packages listed in /sets/bootstrap$distribution, fetched from $ISO/slint
   - the remaining sets of packages to install, fetched from a remote repository if possible (to
     provide their current versions), else from $ISO/slint. These sets are:
     . For Slint, the set fullslint and the sets i3 and/or lxqt and/or mate as chosen by the user
      (function selectcontent)
     . For other distributions, all sets listed in /tmp/set and not yet installed
     
Some Slint packages are also installed in other distributions to bring them additional features,
or to provide more recent packages than those provided in the other distributions. They are listed
in the set slint$distribution.
