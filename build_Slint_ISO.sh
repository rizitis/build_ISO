# fonts/    fonts added to the initramfs matching the locales in which it is translated
# grub/     grub.cfg adapted to Salix, Slackware and Slint
# misc/     Miscellaneous files, see CONTENT in this directory
# sets/     Lists the sets of packages to be installed or added to the iniramfs. Thos used to build
#           the ISO for a distribution are listed in build/set_variables_<distribution>
                     
# Build_Slint_ISO.sh This shell script
