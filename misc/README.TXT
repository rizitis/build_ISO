==========

Welcome to the Slint operating system version +version+

This OS is brought to you by the Slint project.
 
To know more about the Slint project and possibly become a Slint
contributor, visit our wiki:
http://slint.fr/wiki/en/start

The Slint project exists mainly through to the hard work of our
translators and other contributors, thanks to them!

Thanks also to the Salix project and its leader George Vlahavas to whom
Slint borrows tools and ideas.

Of course, the Slint project wouldn't exist without Slackware, brought
to us by Patrick J. Volkerding and contributors. Thanks Pat and crew!

As Slint rely on Slackware, I encourage all Slint users to contribute to
fund Slackware.

Enjoy!
